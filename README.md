# marathon-elasticsearch 

This is a framework based upon the outstanding work of Chris Kite @ https://github.com/chriskite/elasticsearch-marathon. This framework features deployment of an Elasticsearch cluster on Marathon, using a bootstrap script approach for service discovery of all ES nodes within a cluster.

Addition Features
-----------------
I've converted all service discovery logic to Python and added a few more elements:

1. Option for Bridge or Host networking
2. Extension of service discovery to enable clustering across Marathon applications and application groups
3. Load balancing with nginx
4. Coming soon: Cluster-level kibana analysis
